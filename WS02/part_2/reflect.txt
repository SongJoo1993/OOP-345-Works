Question 1.
I believe the significant time difference is due to the fact that the copy operations need to operate a depp copy which is to copy each element of the array of TeenisMatch structs, “t_matches”, from the resource to the destination in sequence.
As opposed to this, the move operations simply copy the address of the to-be-moved object object’s resources to that of destination.

Question 2.
First, I opend the file and read each line while increment “counter” variable by one per each line in order to obtain the total number of tennis matches. 
Then, the memory of the resource “t_matches” was dynamically allocated with the value of “counter” variable therefore we can save the information about each line or each match. 
Since the file was read to the end line, I reset the position of the next character to be extracted so that I can re-read and store each line’s information to the resource “t_matches”.

Question 3.
According to some researches, “steady_clock” is suitable for measuring the time intervals therefore we were directed to use “steady_clock” for this week’s workshop.
The reason behind this argument is that the time points generated by “steady_clock” cannot be modified as it is constant and this clock’s starting moment is the boot time of my PC whereas the time points generated by “system_clock” can be adjusted internally by the operating system.
